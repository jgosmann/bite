[0.2.2] - [2023-02-09]
----------------------

Fixed
^^^^^

* ``StreamReaderBuffer`` will always read sufficient bytes (or up to EOF)
  before returning the slice or index requested with the ``get()`` method.
  Previously, less bytes might have been read causing improper parsing when
  using ``parse_incremental``.


[0.2.1] - [2023-01-10]
----------------------

Fixed
^^^^^

* Remove Python 3.7 classifier as it is no longer supported.


[0.2.0] - [2023-01-10]
----------------------

Added
^^^^^

* Better error reporting if parsing fails: the current input is included in
  the message with the error position highlighted.
* Declare official Python 3.11 support.

Changed
^^^^^^^

* Drop Python 3.7 support


[0.1.3] - 2022-06-11
--------------------

Fixed
^^^^^

* Allow install with Python 3.10 (and later)


[0.1.2] - 2022-02-13
--------------------

Added
^^^^^

* Documentation
* Added ``Forward`` and ``Group`` to ``import * from bite`` import.
* Added ``Forward`` to ``import * from bite.parsers`` import.
* Added ``Group`` to ``miport * from bite.transforms`` import.

Changed
^^^^^^^

* Merged ``bite.core`` into ``bite.parsers``.


[0.1.1] - 2022-01-30
--------------------

Added
^^^^^

* ``Group`` transform to introduce explicit groupings, now that parse values
  are flattened otherwise (see below).
* ``Not`` parser to allow for negative look-ahead.
* ``Forward`` declaration parser to allow for recursive rules.
* ``BytesBuffer`` and ``parse_bytes`` for easier usage without asyncio streams.

Changed
^^^^^^^

* Renamed the ``value`` property of ``ParseNode`` to ``values``. All nodes
  return now iterables and sub-values will be flattened into a common iterable.
* Renamed ``TransformValue`` to ``TransformValue`` as it now gets and is
  expected to produce an iterable of values.
* ``Opt`` has no longer a custom implementation, but is just equivalent to
  ``expr[0, 1]``.

Removed
^^^^^^^

* ``OnlyValue``


Fixed
^^^^^

* Fixed detection of EOF in streams to prevent ``parse_incremental`` from
  raising unexpected parse errors. The ``MockReader`` is now more closely
  matching the EOF behavior of ``StreamReader``.
* Fixed off-by-one error which could lead to a stalling reader waiting for a
  byte that never will be sent.


[0.1.0] - 2022-01-29
--------------------

Initial release.
